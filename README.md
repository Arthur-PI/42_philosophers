# Philosophers

This projects aims to solve the [dinning philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) problem in C with some adjustements.

## Mandatory part

We need to use threads to create each one of the philosophers.

## Bonus part

Same problem but instead of using threads we need to use forks (processes) for each one of the philosophers
